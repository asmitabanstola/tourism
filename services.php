<h3>Rescue Operations</h3>
<p>When it comes to running airline operations, rescue flights and medical evacuations are unequivocally the most essential. Equipped with state of the art facilities and experienced pilots, our highly maneuverable aircrafts make the process easier. </p>
<p>Rescue flights are dispatched in the shortest of time period a request is made. To ensure the clients better health, we always keep an ambulance on standby at the drop-zones so as they can be rushed to the nearest medical facility.</p>
<p>It is advised that clients register with their embassy/consulate in Kathmandu before they embark on their treks. In the case there’s no embassy/consulate in place for their country or clients are trekking on their own, one should arrange something in advance in order to be rescued.</p>
<p>Be sure to have helicopter rescue insurance when purchasing your travel insurance scheme for rescue missions.</p>
